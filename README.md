# Global Pollution Analysis and Energy Recovery Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes global pollution data to understand its impact on energy recovery potential. Using clustering techniques and neural networks, we identify patterns in pollution levels and predict energy recovery capabilities across different countries.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Analyze pollution levels (air, water, soil) across countries
- Cluster countries with similar pollution and energy characteristics
- Predict energy recovery potential using machine learning
- Provide actionable policy recommendations

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling and engineering
   - Categorical encoding

2. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - K-Means clustering
   - Hierarchical clustering
   - Optimal cluster determination

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Neural network (MLPRegressor) implementation
   - Performance evaluation
   - Comparison with baseline models

4. **Insights Generation**:
   - Cluster characteristics analysis
   - Feature importance
   - Policy recommendations
